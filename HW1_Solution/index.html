      <p>I am a Chicago native; grew up on the southside and still currently living there. I am most definitely an urban person but enjoy leaving the hustle and bustle when I can. One of my favorite things to do is travel; I hope to make it to Europe in the next year.</p>

      <p>I went to De La Salle High School where I played basketball and football. Basketball is my favorite sport. My favorite teams are the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. I recently graduated from Elmhurst College; did not play sports there but I did support my fellow Bluejays! My preferred method of exercise is cycling on my peloton; if you peloton, you should follow me and hold me accountable!</p>

      <p>To relax, I enjoy watching The Office or reading; currently reading Outliers. I also enjoy visiting new restaurants and breweries. I worked for Lagunitas Brewing Company for 5 years. They make my favorite beer but I am always willing to try something new.<br> <br> I am extremely excited for this Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp and hoping to transition into a role as a Web Developer in 2020. </p>
